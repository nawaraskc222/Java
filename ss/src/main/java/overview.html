    Java EE Quickstart container managed security and user self-registration.
    <p>The Java layout is pretty vanilla. All of the security is handled by AccountsController.java. The model package has the User and Roel Entities, 
    and the service package has EJB's the AccountController to access the database. The service/RoleSingletonBean is implemented as a Singleton because roles are static
    in this application: they are loaded on initialization and never change.</p>
    <p>Java EE servlet 3.0 defines HttpServletRequest.login and HttpServletRequest.logout and these are implemented by Wildfly.
    The file WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml defines the security context and configuration scripts for the security-domain are provided in the root
    directory. These scripts query the database behind the scenes and implement the URL and other forms of security.</p>  
    <p>URL security is configured in WEB-INF/web.xml and enforced by the container via the security-domain configuration. 
    the webapp/views directory is not restricted, the webapp/views/acounts/user directory is restricted to accounts with a "USER"
    role, and the webapp/views/accounts/admin directory is restricted to accounts with a "ADMIN" role. Security annotations are 
    also placed on the service/UserSessionBean. If unauthorized access to a URL is attempted the client browser is redirected to 
    views/accounts/login.xhtml.</p>
    <p>The src/test/java/test/SiteTest class uses Arquillian, Drone, and Graphene to test the site through the web pages.
    These tests depend on id's and parameters in the jsf/html files to find input fields and submit buttons.</p> 
    <p>The front end is implemented with twitter bootstrap. Care was taken to insure that JSF and Java conventions 
    don't interfere with bootstrap and jquerys' needs, so that those resources are referenced with html scripting tags.<p>
    <p>To extend the model create new model entities and add service beans. Add controllers in support of new views.
    As the application grows it might be a good idea to move navigation into faces-config.xml.</p>
    <p>Finally, this archetype is meant to give users and general idea of java conventions and best practices, so it should provide 
    a lot of useful information and a starting point for Java EE applications.</p>
